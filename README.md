# Artificial Neural Network (ANN) Development and Hyperparameter Optimization Using Optuna

## Project Overview

This project implements an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model to analyze and predict outcomes based on the provided dataset. The model is designed to effectively capture complex patterns by learning from the input features through multiple layers and nonlinear transformations.

To improve the model’s performance and reduce manual tuning efforts, **Optuna**, a powerful hyperparameter optimization framework, is used for automated hyperparameter search and tuning.

## ANN Development Process

The ANN is developed following these key steps:

1. **Data Preparation**  
   - Clean the dataset by handling missing values and removing duplicates.  
   - Normalize or standardize features to ensure uniform scaling.  
   - Split the data into training and validation sets for unbiased evaluation.

2. **Model Architecture Design**  
   - The input layer size matches the number of features in the dataset.  
   - Multiple hidden layers are added, each containing a variable number of neurons.  
   - Activation functions like ReLU or tanh are applied to introduce non-linearity.  
   - Dropout layers are used to prevent overfitting by randomly dropping neurons during training.  
   - The output layer is configured based on the task — for classification, a softmax or sigmoid activation; for regression, a linear activation.

3. **Training the Model**  
   - Use an optimizer such as Adam for efficient gradient descent.  
   - Select an appropriate loss function (e.g., categorical cross-entropy for classification).  
   - Train the model over several epochs, monitoring validation loss to avoid overfitting.

4. **Model Evaluation**  
   - Evaluate model accuracy, loss, or other relevant metrics on validation data.  
   - Analyze performance to decide if further tuning is required.

## Hyperparameter Optimization Using Optuna

Manual hyperparameter tuning is time-consuming and can miss the best parameter combination. This project uses **Optuna** to automate and optimize hyperparameter selection, resulting in improved model performance.

### What is Optuna?

Optuna is an open-source, automatic hyperparameter optimization framework that uses efficient sampling and pruning strategies. It helps find the best combination of hyperparameters by intelligently exploring the search space.

### Hyperparameters Tuned

- Number of hidden layers  
- Number of neurons per layer  
- Activation functions (e.g., ReLU, tanh)  
- Learning rate  
- Batch size  
- Dropout rate  

### Optimization Workflow

1. **Define Objective Function**  
   - The objective function builds and trains an ANN model using hyperparameters suggested by Optuna’s trial.  
   - It returns the validation loss or accuracy to guide the optimization.

2. **Specify Search Space**  
   - Use Optuna's `trial.suggest_int`, `trial.suggest_float`, and `trial.suggest_categorical` methods to define the range and options for each hyperparameter.

3. **Run Optimization**  
   - Call `study.optimize()` to perform multiple trials, where each trial trains a model with a different hyperparameter set.

4. **Select Best Hyperparameters**  
   - After all trials, retrieve the best-performing hyperparameters and train the final model accordingly.

### Benefits of Using Optuna

- **Automated search:** Eliminates manual trial-and-error.  
- **Efficient:** Uses Bayesian optimization and pruning to focus on promising trials.  
- **Flexible:** Easily integrates with various ML frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch.  
- **Scalable:** Can handle large search spaces and parallel executions.

## Conclusion
Random Forest classifier algorithm was used to cross check the validity of the ANN built, it also gave almost the same result about 98% accuracy whereas ANN yeilded 95% accuracy but the only thing which is advantageous in ANN it is mandatory for us to obtain the target value that is the reaction rates are needed to further to be used in the extended version of the project.
